Many dog owners struggle to effectively respond to and manage their dogs' emotional and reactive
behaviors, particularly in high-stress or unexpected situations such as barking at other dog or
behaving abnormally in unfamiliar environments. This issue stems from a lack of tools to help owners
interpret and address their dogs’ behaviors in real-time, compounded by limited opportunities to
learn from these situations to prevent recurrence. This creates challenges in both immediate intervention
and long-term behavior management, leaving owners feeling unprepared and dogs more anxious.
</ProjectImageBlock>
Our approach emphasizes equipping dog owners with the means to respond to immediate behavioral
challenges with Augmented reality (AR) and reflect on those scenarios for deeper understanding
with Virtual reality (VR). By focusing on both the reactive and proactive aspects of behavior
management, the design ensures that owners are not only able to address a situation as it arises
but also gain insights into potential triggers and alternatives for future prevention. This dual
focus helps build owners’ confidence in navigating complex behavioral challenges while fostering
a stronger connection with their pets.

## Design Walkthrough

The focus tasks—supporting in-the-moment crisis response and practicing skills to interpret emotional
cues—align perfectly with DawgSense's dual AR and VR capabilities. The AR mode on Orion glasses enables
real-time detection of behavioral cues and crisis triggers during live interactions with the dog, guiding
the user to de-escalate or manage situations effectively as they happen. The VR practice mode enables
the reflective learning by allowing users to replay past crises and revisit previously encountered
scenarios, learning to identify and interpret signs of anxiety, stress, or aggression in a safe
environment. The synergy between our focused tasks and design stems from
how AR and VR complement each other, creating a well-rounded system that not only enhances immediate
responses but also builds dog owners' foundational knowledge and confidence in understanding and
managing dog behavior in various real-world contexts.

    caption={
        "Select Mode to Start."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"1200px"}

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Support In-The-Moment Response to the Crisis


<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t11,
        alt: "Task 1 Monitoring",
    }}
    caption={
        "Monitoring and Real-Time Analysis Initialization."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Upon activating the monitoring function (AR mode), a pop-up notification “Analyzing in Real-Time” and
a visual clue of the dog’s tail movement status appear. This assures the user that the system is
actively scanning their dog’s behaviors and environmental triggers.
</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t12,
        alt: "Task 1 Detection",
    }}
    caption={
        "Crisis Detection and Warning Message."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

When unusual behavior is detected, such as rapid tail wagging or stiff posture, the system can recognize
these early warning signs and alert the user with a warning message “Unusual Behavior Detected.” This
message is accompanied by a prompt asking the user to confirm the system’s detection.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t13,
        alt: "Task 1 Suggestion",
    }}
    caption={
        "Suggested Interventions and Crisis De-Escalation."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Once a crisis is confirmed, the system presents a series of tailored suggestions to help de-escalate
the situation. These suggestions may include actions like guiding the dog to a calm space, offering a
distraction, or using specific calming commands.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t14,
        alt: "Task 1 Post Intervention",
    }}
    caption={
        "Post-Intervention Feedback and Confirmation."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Once the suggested intervention is completed, the system prompts the user to evaluate their dog’s current
state to adapt dynamically to the outcome, offering further suggestions if necessary.


</ProjectImageBlock>

### Practice Skills Interpreting Dog’s Emotional Triggers and Responses to Prevent Crisis from Occurring

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t21,
        alt: "Task 2 Scenario Selection",
    }}
    caption={
        "Scenario Selection and Initial Setup."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Upon launching the system to practice mode (VR mode), users can choose a crisis scenario based on previously
recorded incidents.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t22,
        alt: "Task 2 Video Watching",
    }}
    caption={
        "Emotion and Trigger Recognition in Simulated Videos."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Once a scenario is selected, users watch a simulated VR video of the incident, observing the dog’s behavior in
real-time. The system then prompts users to identify the dog’s emotional state, such as nervousness or fear, and
the potential triggers causing these emotions.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t23,
        alt: "Task 2 Feedback",
    }}
    caption={
        "Feedback and Learning Support."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

After users submit their responses, the system provides immediate feedback, highlighting whether the correct emotion
and trigger were identified. If any triggers were missed, the system offers a list of potential triggers with
explanations to enhance user understanding and learning.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t24,
        alt: "Task 2 Report",
    }}
    caption={
        "Performance Report and Improvement Suggestions."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

At the end of the session, users receive a personalized report detailing their performance. The report highlights key
achievements, such as correctly identifying emotions and triggers, and offers suggestions for improvement, like focusing
on more nuanced behavioral cues earlier.

## Design Research and Key Insights

The goal of our design research was to understand the challenges dog owners face
in interpreting and managing their pets' emotional and reactive behaviors. We
aimed to identify gaps in current solutions and explore how real-time emotional
monitoring could enhance behavior management. Our method was to conduct
semi-structured interviews with three participants: a dog owner, a veterinarian,
and a dog trainer, each providing unique perspectives on dog behavior, training,
and management. These participants were selected for their diverse experiences,
ensuring a holistic view of the challenges faced. Semi-structured interviews were
chosen to allow flexibility in gathering in-depth insights into dog's emotional cues,
behavioral management, and training needs. This approach
 provided actionable insights that informed our design decisions.

    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"1000px"}
>
</ProjectImageBlock>

### Real-Time Emotional Monitoring Enables Timely Interventions

Interviews revealed that dog owners struggle to recognize early signs of stress or
anxiety in their pets, often leading to delayed responses that exacerbate reactive
behaviors. For instance, a trainer mentioned, “It’s hard to know what’s going on
in her mind until it’s too late, and by then, she’s already reacting.” This insight
highlighted the importance of real-time tools for detecting subtle cues like tucked
tails or pinned ears. Incorporating this into our design, we prioritized features
like AR-driven real-time behavior analysis to guide owners in preventing crises
before they escalate.

### Owner Education Requires Long-Term, Reflective Approaches

Participants emphasized the need for comprehensive education on dog behavior. While
training videos and apps provide some support, they lack personalized guidance
tailored to specific dogs and contexts. The veterinarian noted that “dog owners
need to learn how to manage their own emotions” since stress can transfer to pets.
This insight shaped our focus on combining immediate support with long-term learning
tools, such as VR scenarios for reflective practice, helping owners understand their
dog's triggers and manage interactions proactively.

### Behavioral Triggers are Complex

During interviews with dog owners, a recurring theme emerged: many struggled to identify
the triggers behind their dog's behaviors, especially during stressful situations. One
participant shared, "When she gets stressed, I just pull the leash and take a different
route to help her relax." This response underscores a tendency among owners to rely on reactive
 measures instead of responding appropriately to the behavioral triggers. This insight highlighted the need for tools that
not only provide behavioral cues but also connect these behaviors to the surrounding
environment, such as noise or movement nearby. This learning pushed us to prioritize
real-time contextual support as a central aspect of the design.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: overviewPaper,
        alt: "design overview."
    }}
    caption={
        "Overview of the Paper Prototype."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"300px"}
>
Our iterative design process started with low-fidelity sketches to establish basic design concepts
based on our design research. We evolved these sketches into storyboards and task
walkthroughs to convey context and illustrate interactions, focusing on two primary
tasks: supporting in-the-moment crisis responses and practicing behavioral
interpretation. This led to the development of paper prototypes and heuristic evaluations, where we
identified crucial usability issues such as the absence of a back/undo button and
confusing visual indicators.
</ProjectImageBlock>
Usability testing with target users further revealed
problems like insufficient feedback, complex task flows, and unclear navigation,
which informed our refinement in the digital mockup stage, such as refining a cohesive
and functional interface for both focused tasks and adding a 'History & Reports'
interface to enhance user reflective learning.

Reflecting on this process, the iterative nature of our design approach—from
prototyping to user testing—was instrumental in uncovering and addressing user
needs effectively, making the final design both intuitive and effective. Each cycle
provided critical insights that directly shaped subsequent revisions, culminating in
a design that helps dog owners manage and understand their pets' behavior both in
real time and through reflective learning.

### Streamlining Interaction Complexity Enhances User Efficiency and Engagement

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: insights1before,
            alt: "separate interface",
            caption: "Before: Two separate homepages were designed for each focused task. "
        },
        {
            src: insights1after,
            alt: "integrated homepage",
            caption: "After: Both focused tasks have been integrated into a single homepage. " +
                     "Users can now choose between the two modes."
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"350px"}
>

In our initial paper prototype, users were required to use two distinct interfaces
to accomplish each of our focused tasks—“Monitor in Real-Time” and “Practice Your
Skills.” This separation not only introduced unnecessary complexity but also disrupted
the fluidity of the user experience. Observations during usability testing underscored
the confusion caused by this disjointed interaction model.

To address these issues, we consolidated both key functionalities into a unified 'Home'
interface in our digital mockup. This integration
allows users to seamlessly toggle between monitoring in real-time and practicing their
skills without the need to switch contexts. This design refinement simplifies user
interactions and enhances the accessibility of the application, fostering a more cohesive
and streamlined experience. It encourages more intuitive and personalized engagement
with the system, significantly boosting user satisfaction and efficiency. By streamlining
these features into a single interface, the revised design effectively supports users in
achieving their intended goals with greater ease, thereby elevating the overall utility
and user-friendliness of our application.

### Intuitive Navigation and Responsive Controls Empower User Experience

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: insights2before,
            alt: "interface without exit/back button.",
        },
        {
            src: insights2after,
            alt: "interface with exit/back button.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Before the change, there is no button to go back or exit. A Back Button was added to allow users to navigate" +
        ", and an Exit Button was added to provide a clear way to leave the session entirely."
    }
    width={5}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our heuristic evaluations and usability tests highlighted the lack of essential navigation and
directive elements. For instance, one user accessed the main interface but struggled
to navigate to the next frame due to the lack of clear prompts. In another case, a
user wanted to switch from practicing how to identify potential 'barking' warnings to
'shaking' warnings. However, due to the absence of functionality for modifying selections,
the user was unable to make any changes once a choice had been made. This
oversight limited users' ability to perform, adjust, or revert actions, leading to
frustration and a diminished sense of control over the application, contrary to the
User Control and Freedom heuristic.

To address these issues, we enhanced the design to include backward navigation
and undo functionalities, thereby empowering users with the flexibility to
easily navigate back or terminate actions when they change their minds.
Additionally, we introduced a 'continue' button on the homepage and a new
interface detailing various operational modes. These enhancements make the progression
steps and available functionalities clear, significantly improving the user experience
by ensuring consistency and simplifying navigation. Together, these improvements have
transformed our design into a more user-friendly and responsive tool, enhancing both its
functional integrity and user satisfaction.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Instructive Feedback is the Key to Enhance User Progress and Long-Term Learning

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: insights3before,
            alt: "interface with vague post-practice summary",
            caption: "Before: Post-practice feedback screen displaying the vague 'Good Job' message " +
                     "without any additional description or summary."
        },
        {
            src: insights3after,
            alt: "interface with detailed post-practice summary",
            caption: "After: Post-practice feedback screen displaying the detailed " +
                     "summary of user performance and further improvements."
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"300px"}
>

The usability tests revealed that the initial feedback mechanisms after completing practice sessions were
too general and lacked detailed, actionable feedback. Users received generic messages like 'Good Job!'
without a comprehensive breakdown of their performance or suggestions for improvement. This deficiency
in meaningful feedback violated the Visibility of System Status and Feedback heuristic, as it failed to
communicate to users how well they performed and how they could improve. The absence of actionable information
hindered the learning process, leaving users unable to gauge their progress or identify areas requiring attention.

To address this shortfall, the feedback mechanism was overhauled to include both positive reinforcement
and constructive suggestions. In the revised design, post-training feedback not only praises correct actions,
such as identifying early signs of anxiety with statements like 'You identified early signs of anxiety correctly.
Great work!', but it also highlights specific areas for improvement, such as 'Focus on noticing tail movements earlier,'
accompanied by actionable advice. This enhancement is highly effective for long-term learning.
